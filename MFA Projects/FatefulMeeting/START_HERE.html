<br>


Through-out highschool and college I played Dungeons and Dragons weekly
with the same group of people.&nbsp; After college I went off to Europe
for a year.&nbsp; When I returned and was between Jobs I stayed back in
my home town and picked up with the same group of friends.<br>


<br>


This time around I got to know another member of the group better, a
young-woman a few years younger then I, and started hanging around and
chatting with her.&nbsp; Lets call her Stacey for the purpose of this
essay.&nbsp; What I didn't realize at the time was that Stacey was
conceiving a crush on me, whereas I viewed her strictly as a
friend. &nbsp;My birthday rolled around and Stacey decided to throw me a
birthday party.&nbsp; She wasn't much of a cook at the time, so she
asked a friend of hers to cook for the party.&nbsp; At the time the
friend was working in an insurance office and came to the party
straight from work.&nbsp; I turned to David, a married male member of
the group at whose house the party was being held,&nbsp; and asked "Who
is that?" &nbsp;<a href="Jeff1.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 51px; height: 66px;" alt="Jeff's Thoughts" src="Jeff_head.png" align="top"></a><br>

"Oh," he answered, "that's Shelley". &nbsp;After dinner, the women drifted
into one group and started talking about opera, and the guys drifted to
another corner and mostly talked about roleplay games. &nbsp;<a href="jeff2.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 45px; height: 58px;" alt="Jeff's thoughts" src="Jeff_head.png" align="top"></a> <a href="Shell1.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 45px; height: 53px;" alt="Shelley,'s thoughs" src="Shelley_head.png" align="top"></a> <a href="Cupid1.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 62px; height: 63px;" alt="Cupid's thoughts" src="cupid_no_bkgd.png" align="top"></a><br>

The next time I saw Shelley, it was at the weekly D&amp;D game, which
was held at the University's student union.&nbsp; Shelley did not play,
but came by to say hi on her way to her cousin's birthday party on the
Union terrace.&nbsp; She was dressed down this time but still well
put-together.<a href="jeff3.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 45px; height: 58px;" alt="Jeff's thoughts" src="Jeff_head.png" align="top"></a> &nbsp;<a href="Cupid2.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 61px; height: 61px;" alt="Cupid's thoughts" src="cupid_no_bkgd.png" align="top"></a><br>


<br>


<br>


While she was there, a "helpful" friend of mine proceeded to steal my
wallet and quietly arrange it on the table for all to see.&nbsp; This
included my requisite virgin's one condom, which embarrassed me
thoroughly.<a href="Jeff4.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 41px; height: 53px;" alt="Jeff's thoughts" src="Jeff_head.png" align="top"></a> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="Shell2.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 42px; height: 48px;" alt="Shelley's thoughts" src="Shelley_head.png" align="top"></a> &nbsp;<a href="Cupid3.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 55px; height: 55px;" alt="Cupid's Thoughts" src="cupid_no_bkgd.png" align="top"></a><br>


&nbsp;<br>


<br>


The next week was the fourth of July and David gave me a call to see if
I would like to go with the group to a movie and fireworks
afterward.&nbsp; I asked who was coming and was told "Rebecca and I,
and Stacey, oh and maybe Shelley."&nbsp; I said sure. &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="Jeff5.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 35px; height: 45px;" alt="Jeff's thoughts" src="Jeff_head.png" align="top"></a> &nbsp;<a href="Cupid4.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 46px; height: 46px;" alt="Cupid's thoughts" src="cupid_no_bkgd.png" align="top"></a><br>


<br>


<br>


The movie turned out to be Roger Rabbit, which was right up my areas of
expertise, and afterward we went to the park and had a pic nic.&nbsp;
During the pic nic we discussed the movie and I had a lot to contribute
both in terms of how this movie fit into a broader media context as
well as some guesses as to how the SFX were accomplished. &nbsp;<a href="Shell3.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 43px; height: 50px;" alt="Shelley's thoughts" src="Shelley_head.png" align="top"></a> &nbsp;<a href="Cupid5.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 49px; height: 50px;" alt="Cupid's thoughts" src="cupid_no_bkgd.png" align="top"></a><br>


<br>


<br>


After dinner, I offered to give Shelley a backrub, and talked about
seeing another movie, the two of us.&nbsp; As us old folks used to do
this, I asked her for her phone number and called a few days late to
set-up the date. &nbsp; <a href="Cupid6.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 62px; height: 64px;" alt="Cupid's thoughts" src="cupid_no_bkgd.png" align="top"></a><br>
