Game: </span>DC Universe Online<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span>: &nbsp;Maxine Elisabeth Stone<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Birthplace</span>: Bludhaven, USA (Fictional City in th DC Universe<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Origin:<br />
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Max was always a jock. &nbsp;In middle school and highschool she competed and took first place awards in gymnastics.<br />
When she graduated she was offered a scholarship to Gotham University
and a place on the gymnastics team. &nbsp;But her goals were higher and
she went with the intention of making the next US Olympic Team.<br />
<br />
Two years into her college career however, disaster struck. &nbsp;Her
home city of Bludhaven was destroyed and everyone she knew killed in
the fallout of a major super hero/super villain fight. &nbsp;Distraught
and having lost her motivation to compete, she quit school and stayed
in Gotham waitressing and doing whatever other odd jobs she could get
by day, drinking mostly alone by night.<br />
<br />
She was in this state when she met a man in her favorite bar one night
who suggested she could do more with her life. &nbsp;He represented a
united nations organization called Checkmate that was dedicated to
policing the use of super-powers and protecting ordinary people.
&nbsp;With her gymnastics training he thought she might make an
excellent soldier.<br />
<br />
She joined Checkmate as a pawn and went through a year of grueling
training. &nbsp;Among other programs she was placed with the marines
for 5 months to go through the Marine Combat Martial Arts Program
(MCMAP) and learn to fight like a marine. &nbsp;The baret she wears
proudly with her Checkmate uniform was awarded to her by the marines
upon her completing the program.<br />
<br />
After that she spent two years as a black king's pawn, which translates
to a first level field operative. &nbsp;She distinguished herself
&nbsp;in action and, when the Black King's Knight quit under a cloud,
she was promoted to that position.<br />
<br />
As a Black Knight, she leads solo or group field operations to
neutralize super and super-tech threats to the common peace. &nbsp;When
Braniac invaded she was sent to observe and assist on the Gotham front.<br />
