<span style="font-weight: bold;">Name</span>: &nbsp;Alice Littlefield aka "Agent Littlefield" or "Mr. Terry"<br />


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Birthplace</span>: &nbsp;Kingston, New York, &nbsp;USA<br />


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Origin:<br />


</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Alice had a blessed childhood gorwing
up as a pretty, popular girl in the small town of Kingston New York.
&nbsp;The only child of a mathematician and a software engineer, both
who worked for the locla IBM plant, she grew up priviledged and doted
on. &nbsp;She excelled in her schoolwork with a particular knack for
math and the sciences. &nbsp;She was also an active theater nerd and by
highschool was makign pretty decent pocket money as a performing
magiciain. &nbsp;A genuinely nice young lady, the worst her peers could
say about her was that she was too dman nice to hate.<br />
<br />
After high-school she was acepted to MIT and moved down to Boston.
&nbsp;At MIT she double majored in cognitive psychology and physics
with a focus on optics. As a master's thesis she combined both in a
stunning illusion where she made a battleship disappear from the boston
harbor on live TV and infront of hundreds of live spectators. &nbsp;Her
life pattern seemed set with her first vegas performign contract signed
and neotations under way for a television special.<br />
<br />
Then disaster struck. &nbsp;The earth was being watched by an alien
species called the Rikti who were planning to invade.
&nbsp;Intercepting the TV broadcast, they were stunned to see an entire
battleship vanish in an instant. &nbsp;Not having this sort of
entertainment themselves they assumed that what they were watching was
a weapon demonstration and, as she wlaked hoime that nigh all a glow
from her success, they swooped in and grabbed her,<br />
<br />
Rikti technology was based on psionic principles and the Rikti
themslves were a telepathic race. &nbsp;They used their technology to
dig deep into her mind to try to get an answer as to what this "new
weapon" was. &nbsp;By the time they figured out it was a hoax, she was
serverly traumatized, but not so badly that she couldn't find a way tp
eascape. &nbsp;Plamign off small peices of hardware every time they
took her otu of her cell, she managed to splice together a dvice that
temporarily inetrfered with the ships power. &nbsp;During the black-out
and almost-crash, she got free of her cell and bailed out of the ship
over the New York harbor.<br />
<br />
She was rescued from the water by coast gaurd who came out in response
to the almost-crashed saucer sightings. &nbsp; She gave her device of
alien aprts to them and went back home to Kingston to try to put her
life back together. &nbsp;Three weeks later, there was a knock on her
door, when she oipened it she was met by two gentlemen in black suits
and sunglasses. &nbsp; The explained that theyt were from the Bureau of
Alien Information and Control. &nbsp;Her device had been sent to them
and their lab people, frankly, were stumped by it. &nbsp;They imrpessed
on her that a war was coming and that her country needed her to come
work with them and help them figure it all out. &nbsp;So, still
struggling with some PTSD, she put her past life behind her and traveld
to Paragon City as a sermior researcher for Project Mystery (soneone
having had a sense of humor in accounting.).<br />
<br />
Working with cpatured peices of alient echn ology she eventually
cobbled together a psionic weapon. &nbsp;As the city was already full
of "supoer-heroes" she concluded that she could cover field tests by
assuming a "super-hero" identity and thus was born &nbsp;the black
suited mystery-woman "Ms. Terry". &nbsp;(A &nbsp;pun on the project
name.)<br />
<br />
As Ms. Terry she started interacting with one particular group who
called themselves "The Survivors", being to drawn to the fact that all
the members had had less then positive encounters with the Rikti. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
And thats where she entered play. <br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notable Quotes</span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Throughout history magicians
have had only three ways of making something disappear. &nbsp;&nbsp;Her
story was much further developed<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first is hide it. &nbsp;The
second is move it. &nbsp;But the best, if you can get away with it is
never to have it there to begin with."<br />

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;Her story was much further
developed through play-interaction as well as roleplayed "workshopping"
over many years. &nbsp;Most of the story is collected here as<br />
