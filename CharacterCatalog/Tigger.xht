<div style="margin-left: 40px;">People seeing Tigger for the first time
often think he's a tiger-man. &nbsp;He's not. &nbsp;He's a
&nbsp;man-tiger. &nbsp;An old, tired male Tiger who was infected with
the super-virus by a malfunction braniac nanite he was restored to his
youthful vigor in an anthropomorphic form. &nbsp;He finds the shape of
his new body and the thoughts he has now strange, but finds them a
small price to pay for his returned energy,. &nbsp;He feels like a
young tiger again and can do all the thinsg he enjoyes most; &nbsp;run,
jump chase, fight and eat!<br />
<br />
The funny apes that used to feed him have given him a little robot that
follows him around and helps him on how to talk and act in his new body
&nbsp;He calls it "big-fly." &nbsp; He also has a pet house-cat that he
calls, "little cat." &nbsp; And he gets to run and jump and chase and
fight. &nbsp;Alot.<br />
<br />
All in all, life is pretty good. &nbsp;<br />
