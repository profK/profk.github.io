<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Alex was born to a fine family tradition, going all the way back to a man society remembers as "Robin Hood".<br />
The Godberd family busines is theaft, but not low class robbery.
&nbsp;It is a point of pride that no one is ever hurt in a Godberd
caper. &nbsp;Indeed Alex refuses to carry or use a gun, though in
family tradition he is an expert bowman. &nbsp;He's also an expert martial artist.<br />
<br />
Alex was into his late twenties when he got reckless and got caught.
&nbsp; Checkmate offered him a deal. &nbsp;Work for us and we will get
you out, pay you a salery, and use your abilities for the good of the
world. &nbsp;As part of the deal, they gave him a new alias as
"Alexander St. John Smyth", a UN expense account, and rewarding work.
&nbsp;His expertise and analyzing and planning missions as well as his
abiltiy to blend into almost any social milleau eventually brought him
to the position of White Queen's Bishop., &nbsp;The bishops are the
advisers to the royalty, who are the senior officers in charge of
Checkmate. &nbsp;Only royalty out-rank a bishop.<br />
